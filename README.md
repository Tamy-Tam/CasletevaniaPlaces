This project that was created by [Chris](https://github.com/chrisgalet18), [Eric](https://github.com/ericverzel) and [I](https://github.com/Tamy-Tam) during week 7 of [Le Wagon Marseille](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/le-wagon-marseille/) 🚀   web development bootcamp 🤓 .

As we were asked to build (conceive, code and deploy) a sort of clone of AirBnb we came with this crazy idea of a CastleBnb. Because, who wouldn't want to rent out a castle for their next vacations ? It also give you enought space for your kids when they decide to play their weird video games 🎮

As such, Castlevania was born.  


🖥 We have deployed our site [here](https://castlevania-demo.herokuapp.com/)
